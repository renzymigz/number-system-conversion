A number system converter; I would say a certain someone heavily inspires this type of design. 

At the moment, it only supports 4 main number systems.

In terms of design, it primarily focuses on desktop mode; adapting it for mobile mode might give me a little trouble (but would you lose? nah I'd win). As of now, I don't plan on creating a mobile version.

Originally for the folder, it was supposedly for an app/electron.js, but nah imma do my own thing.
